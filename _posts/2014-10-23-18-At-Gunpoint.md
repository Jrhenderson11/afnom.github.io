You're the sheriff of a small town, investigating news about a gangster squad
passing by. Rumor has it they're easy to outsmart, so you have just followed one
to their encampment by the river. You know you can easily take them out one by
one, if you would just know their secret handshake..

	gunpoint_2daf5fe3fb236b398ff9e5705a058a7f.dat: Gameboy ROM: "FLUX", [ROM ONLY], ROM: 256Kbit


Nice, a gameboy ROM. Searching for `gameboy emulator` gets us
[Visual Boy Advance](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vba/) as the first result. We need to
change the extension to `gbc` to be able to open the file in the emulator.
After running the game for some time or doing `options->emulator->speed up
toggle`, we get:

So probably we need to guess the secret key combination. Fortunately emulator
has also dissasembler and IDA is also able to dissaseble the code.
[Here](http://www.opusgames.com/games/GBDev/zips/Gbspec.txt) is some thorough
description of Gameboy hardware. The most interesting part is here:


	FF00
		Name     - P1
		Contents - Register for reading joy pad info
              and determining system type.    (R/W)
			  
           Bit 7 - Not used
           Bit 6 - Not used
           Bit 5 - P15 out port
           Bit 4 - P14 out port
           Bit 3 - P13 in port
           Bit 2 - P12 in port
           Bit 1 - P11 in port
           Bit 0 - P10 in port
		   
         This is the matrix layout for register $FF00:
		 
		 
                 P14        P15
                  |          |
        P10-------O-Right----O-A
                  |          |
        P11-------O-Left-----O-B
                  |          |
        P12-------O-Up-------O-Select
                  |          |
        P13-------O-Down-----O-Start
                  |          |
				  
       Example code:
	   
          Game: Ms. Pacman
          Address: $3b1
		  
        LD A,$20       <- bit 5 = $20
        LD ($FF00),A   <- select P14 by setting it low
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)   <- wait a few cycles
        CPL            <- complement A
        AND $0F        <- get only first 4 bits
        SWAP A         <- swap it
        LD B,A         <- store A in B
        LD A,$10
        LD ($FF00),A   <- select P15 by setting it low
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)
        LD A,($FF00)   <- Wait a few MORE cycles
        CPL            <- complement (invert)
        AND $0F        <- get first 4 bits
        OR B           <- put A and B together
		
        LD B,A         <- store A in D
        LD A,($FF8B)   <- read old joy data from ram
        XOR B          <- toggle w/current button bit
        AND B          <- get current button bit back
        LD ($FF8C),A   <- save in new Joydata storage
        LD A,B         <- put original value in A
        LD ($FF8B),A   <- store it as old joy data
		
		
        LD A,$30       <- deselect P14 and P15
        LD ($FF00),A   <- RESET Joypad
        RET            <- Return from Subroutine
		
          The button values using the above method are such:
          $80 - Start             $8 - Down
          $40 - Select            $4 - Up
          $20 - B                 $2 - Left
          $10 - A                 $1 - Right
		  
          Let's say we held down A, Start, and Up.
          The value returned in accumulator A would be $94


If we go to `Tools->Dissasemble` then we have a fairly good chance we land up in
the code that is almost the same. (If not press `Next` few times) We can see
that the result of the key presses are stored in addresses `C0A1` and `C0A2`.
Counter at address `C0A0` is increased each time we press the correct key. Using
`Tools->Memory viewer` we can see when we press the correct key. The sequence is 
`up, left, down, right, up, left, down, right, B, B A, A`.
