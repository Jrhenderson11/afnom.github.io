The challenge consists of going through a VirtualBox snapshot of a Linux system and reading a file stored on an encrypted LUKS volume on the virtual machine. 
First, we need to convert the virtual disk from .vdi format to raw format to be able to mount it:

	{% highlight bash %}
	VBoxManage clonehd --format RAW [filename].vdi disk.img
	{% endhighlight %}

Now we can mount it:

	{% highlight bash %}
	losetup /dev/loop0 disk.img
	kpartx -a /dev/loop0
	vgscan
	vgchange -ay vg
	{% endhighlight %}

In this particular case, there were 2 LVM's, home and root. The encrypted one was home. The LVM's are found under /dev/vg/
Next, we need to take a memory dump of the running machine in the saved state, to get the AES key used for LUKS encryption from main memory.

	{% highlight bash %}
	VBoxManage debugvm <uuid|vmname> dumpvmcore --filename memdump.elf
	{% endhighlight %}

We can use [aeskeyfind](https://citp.princeton.edu/research/memory/code/) to find the  master key:

	{% highlight bash %}
	aeskeyfind memdump.elf
	{% endhighlight %}

After finding the key, we can decrypt the volume. Note the master key needs to be supplied in hex format:

	{% highlight bash %}
	echo <key> | xxd -r -p > masterkey
	cryptsetup luksOpen --master-key-file masterkey /dev/vg/home decrypted
	mount /dev/mapper/decrypted /mnt/decrypted
	{% endhighlight %}

That's it. You now have access to the unencrypted volume.
