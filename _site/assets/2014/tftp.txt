It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an

and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE.
He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.

The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his
PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and
walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so
CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping
peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the
tin cup between the entrance bar.

The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit
up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the
block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and
one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of
scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the
cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while
