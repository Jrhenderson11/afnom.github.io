## Hanoi As A Service, Pwnable 50

One of the easist challenges of PoliCTF and the first we solved. The challenge's description pointed us to "haas.polictf.it 80". Netcating in we found a Tower of Hanoi server:

{% highlight php %}

host$ nc haas.polictf.it 80
Welcome to the Hanoi-as-a-Service cloud platform!
How many disks does your tower have?
3
* Move top disk from a to b
* Move top disk from a to c
* Move top disk from b to c
* Move top disk from a to b
* Move top disk from c to a
* Move top disk from c to b
* Move top disk from a to b
{% endhighlight %}
