## Description

178.63.58.69 3016

usr: ctf, pass: canyoudoit

flag in /home/flag/flag.txt

## Solution

Once logged in, there's nothing interesting found inside the `.bash_history`
file, although it's good to see they've tried checking vulnerabilities for
example the ShellShock attack.

Likewise, we see `/home/flag` has no access controls present which allow us to
read, write or execute anything in the directory. All attempts at directly
reading the `/home/flag/flag.txt` file gave us access denied.

Looking in `/bin` and `/sbin` yields nothing, but if we perform `ls -al
/usr/bin`, there's a file called `...` which is owned by `flag`, but part of
the group `ctf`. It has `s` permissions, and when executed, it gives us a
Python shell, running as flag.

Here, it's simple. We write a bit of python in the interpreter that opens
`/home/flag/flag.txt`, and prints it. The script is below:

      f = open('/home/flag/txt', 'r')
      print f     

This prints out the flag.
